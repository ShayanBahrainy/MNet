# MNet
An LTE network for Morgan Hill, CA operating on CBRS frequencies, allowing users to view media from anywhere in town.


# Why?
I have a big interest in how the internet works, at the most basic level. I've read about Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), and other cool things. My house is too far from the nearest datacenter to actually set something up (unfortunately). I'm very interested in tech infrastructure. This is a good replacement, because I still get to learn about networks and radio bands, etc.
