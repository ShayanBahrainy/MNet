# June 18-20: Research

I spent many hours figuring out what parts I needed and learning. Going in, I didn't know anything about cellular networks, power over ethernet, and Highway itself. I spent a lot of time reading and learning things. I learned about how the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) provides a spectrum that is easier to access. You just have to go through a SAS (Spectrum Access Service), this is a company that manages the spectrum between the lowest priority users (You), the license providers (like T-Mobile), and the Navy. You pay them a small fee, and they tell your device when you can access the spectrum and for how long, and on what frequencies. This is a very good option for people to me as opposed to very expensive licenses from the FTC for other spectrums. For example, Auction 73, in 2008, raised 19.5 billion dollars for the FCC. Google paid 287 million dollars just to be able to bid. This shows how the CBRS is a great thing for individuals and small to medium businesses. This was just reading, so I don't have any photos. I noticed how different cellular base stations are used, inside, outside, for wireless internet service providers (WISPs). I figured out at least what class of base station I was going, something low power, and for the outdoors.

# June 21rd: Bill of Materials

I figured out how to fit all the small items necessary into the $350 budget. For a good minute, I thought this wouldn't be possible. I did some research, and it seems Apple only allows companies with agreements with them to create eSim profiles on ios. This means I would need an actual sim card in my phone, but since my iPhone, like most in the US, doesn't have a sim card port this would be impossible. This temporarily ruined the fun, when I realized I wouldn't be able to use my network. Then, the realization struck me that I could connect my laptop. For my laptop, I would need a cellular modem, and I would need a sim card writer, and sim cards. This was another point, I didn't think this project was viable because those things appeared to be very expensive, at dozens of dollars. Looking on eBay, I saw cheaper alternatives that would just barely fit in my budget. While looking at all the items, I saw cheaper deals, but I marked around the mid-point because I didn't know if the cheaper deals would still be around when I came to buy them. So if I find the cheaper option on just a few of my parts, this whole thing would fit much more comfortably.

# June 22-23: CAD

I am working on the CAD model for this project, I am modeling the Nova227 Cell that is the heart and soul of the project. I also made a simplified model of a Raspberry Pi 4, I just made a green board with an ethernet port which is the most important part of the Raspberry Pi for this project. 

I didn't know how to model ethernet good in OnShape, so I just put them on top of each other, and wired them in a separate diagram.

# June 27th: Readme + wiring diagram

Today, I started by finishing up my CAD model for this project. I cleaned up my part for the Power over Ethernet+ injector, and assembled it in OnShape. This took a while, after I spent time reviewing the submission requirements and uploading files. I worked on completing the readme, the requirements said that if there is any non-pcb wiring, that I should make a diagram. I don't think this was necessary as it was a couple cables powering the whole thing. I did it anyway, just in case.
